DiamondActivityIndicator for iOS
==================================

This is a remake of the UIActivityIndicatorView class. It's based on [this](http://dribbble.com/shots/1185018-Diamond-Loading-Indicator-GIF) concept by [@Sentry_NC](https://twitter.com/Sentry_NC) (original concept gif below).

Even though it is not a subclass of UIActivityIndicatorView, the DiamondActivityIndicator class's methods are identical and it can function as a drop-in replacement for any UIActivityIndicatorView. This repository has code for a sample iOS project so you can try the view out yourself.
